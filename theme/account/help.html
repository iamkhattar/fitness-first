            FitnessFirst 'Normal Price' is usually the Manufacturer's or
            Supplier's Recommended Retail Price and may include carriage where
            applicable. On imported and 'Own Branded' products, our 'Normal
            Price' is based on equivalent products in the market and can be
            quantified on request.
          </div>

          <div class="col-12 pt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
            <h5>WARRANTIES</h5>
            All new equipment sold by FitnessFirst is covered by a minimum one
            year parts and labour cover (excludes parts-only products) for
            domestic use only, (excluding consumable parts), unless the item
            states it is suitable for light commercial or commercial use. In
            many cases the warranty is greater than this. The warranty on
            equipment we sell varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. It can
            include a full on site repair facility or a 'back to base' warranty.
            In some cases, where there is a minor fault, the manufacturer will
            send a part by mail for the customer to fit (This warranty excludes
            consumable parts and damage caused by accident, or misuse).
            Equipment sold for home or commercial use, is warranted for use in a
            normal habitable building environment. Manufacturers reserve the
            right to cancel warranties (on certain types of electronic
            equipment) if equipment is used in a non standard environment, this
            may include external buildings such as Sheds and Garages, and areas
            close to a swimming pool, where the ambient temperature varies
            significantly from a standard environment. Warranty for light
            commercial or full commercial equipment varies, please contact our
            sales department to clarify warranty status on individual equipment.
            If an item develops a fault, please contact us stating the equipment
            you have, (brand and model number), serial number and a brief
            description of the fault. FitnessFirst will either arrange to send a
            part for the customer to fit, if this is practical and simply
            applied or affixed by a reasonable person, send an engineer to site,
            or in some instances, ask that the goods be returned to our
            warehouse for examination. Goods must be well packaged prior to
            collection. No goods will be accepted into our warehouse without
            prior authorisation from FitnessFirst. FitnessFirst will then repair
            or replace the equipment with an equivalent or better model and
            deliver the goods back to the customer at our expense. Please note
            all equipment is warranted for mainland UK use. In certain
            circumstances, we may extend this to cover parts and or labour out
            with UK mainland, or we may offer a ‘back to base’ labour warranty.
            In cases of ‘back to base’ for goods out with UK mainland warranty,
            the customer may have to cover the cost of shipping to and from
            ‘base’, for further information, please contact us prior to
            purchase.
